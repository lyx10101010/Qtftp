Prerequisites:
- A C++11 compliant C++ compiler. QTFTP has been tested with clang 3.6.0, g++ 4.9 (including MinGW) and Visual Studio 2015. Visual Studio 2013 can't compile QTFTP.
- CMake 3.2 or higher
- Qt 5.4.0 or higher. Only the Qtcore, Qtnetwork and Qttest libraries are required.  (Qt versions 5.0 - 5.3 might work but have not been tested)

Optional dependencies:
- If you want to build HTML reference documentation: doxygen
- If you want to build PDF reference documentation: doxygen, latex, makeindex


QTFTP uses CMake for building.

Linux / OS X build instructions:
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String=Release  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<QTFTP_INSTALL_DESTINATION>  <QTFTP_SOURCE_DIR>
- make
- make doc
- make install


Windows build instructions (MinGW)
- open command prompt and make sure that both the directories of the CMake and MinGW executable are included in the PATH variable
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String=Release  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<QTFTP_INSTALL_DESTINATION>  <QTFTP_SOURCE_DIR>
- mingw32-make
- mingw32-make doc
- mingw32-make install

Windows build instructions (Visual Studio 2015, 32bit target)
- open Visual Studio command prompt from the Visual Studio folder in the start menu
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015" <QTFTP_SOURCE_DIR>
- msbuild qtftp.sln /p:Configuration=Release

Windows build instructions (Visual Studio 2015, 64bit target)
- open Visual Studio command prompt from the Visual Studio folder in the start menu
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" <QTFTP_SOURCE_DIR>
- msbuild qtftp.sln /p:Configuration=Release

Additional instructions for all platforms:
- if Qt is not installed in a standard location, you can specify the Qt install dir with the following CMake option: -DQT_PREFIX:Path=<QT_INSTALL_DIR>
- 'make test' will run all unit tests
