Prerequisites:
- A C++14 compliant C++ compiler. Libtftp has been tested with clang 3.7.0, g++ 5 (including MinGW) and Visual Studio 2015. Visual Studio 2013 can't compile libtftp.
- CMake 3.2 or higher
- Qt 5.4.0 or higher. Only the Qtcore, Qtnetwork and Qttest libraries are required.  (Qt versions 5.0 - 5.3 might work but have not been tested)

Optional dependencies:
- If you want to build HTML reference documentation: doxygen
- If you want to build PDF reference documentation: doxygen, latex, makeindex


Libtftp uses CMake for building.

Linux / OS X build instructions:
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String=Release <libtftp_source_dir>
- make
- make doc
- make install

If you want to build against qt libraries that are installed in a non-standard location you can add the following option to cmake:


Windows build instructions (MinGW)
- open command prompt and make sure that both the directories of the CMake and MinGW executable are included in the PATH variable
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake -G"MinGW Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:String=Release  <libtftp_source_dir>
- mingw32-make
- mingw32-make doc
- mingw32-make install

Windows build instructions (Visual Studio 2015, 32bit target)
- open Visual Studio command prompt from the Visual Studio folder in the start menu
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015" <libtftp_source_dir>
- msbuild libftp.sln /p:Configuration=Release

Windows build instructions (Visual Studio 2015, 64bit target)
- open Visual Studio command prompt from the Visual Studio folder in the start menu
- cd <build_dir>
- cmake -G"Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64" <libtftp_source_dir>
- msbuild libftp.sln /p:Configuration=Release

Additional instructions for all platforms:
- if Qt is not installed in a standard location, you can specify the Qt install dir with the following CMake option: 
   -DQT_PREFIX=<qt_install_dir>
   
- 'make test' will run all unit tests
  IMPORTANT: in order to let all unit tests succeed you must remove all permissions from file 
  test/unit/test_files/no_permission.txt with command: chmod 000 test/unit/test_files/no_permission.txt
